Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer
Architected and deployed large-scale AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform, building reusable modules for compute, networking, security, and data platforms; improved environment provisioning speed by 65% and reduced configuration drift across Dev/QA/PreProd/Prod.
Built end-to-end Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for EC2, VPC, Subnets, Routing, ALBs/NLBs, Security Groups, IAM Roles/Policies, KMS, SSM, Secrets Manager, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Glue, MWAA, Step Functions, SNS, and OpenSearch.
Designed a fully automated OpenSearch/ELK platform including index templates, pipelines, ISM/ILM policies, hot-warm-cold tiering, dashboards, alerts, KNN search configs, and cross-cluster search integrations.
Led migration of Airflow services to Amazon MWAA, modernizing orchestration pipelines, reducing scheduler failures by 80%, and eliminating on-prem dependencies.
Converted legacy CloudFormation → Terraform codebases supporting 100+ AWS resources, enforcing module standardization, tagging compliance, encryption requirements, and environment-specific parameterization.
Modernized the enterprise-wide EDC (Enterprise Data Cloud) platform by migrating to AWS 2.0, re-architecting ETL pipelines, Glue jobs, data quality rules, and S3 → Iceberg table conversion for analytical workloads.
Built scalable ETL pipelines using Glue, PySpark, Lambda, and DataBrew to ingest, cleanse, validate, transform, catalog, and publish datasets into Apache Iceberg tables backed by Glue Catalog.
Implemented automated orchestration for Iceberg table lifecycle: schema evolution, partitioning, vacuum/compaction, metadata pruning, snapshots, and version rollback.
Created a fully autonomous AI Agent for Terraform (Python + LLM) capable of:
Understanding user requests in natural language
Generating Terraform resources, modules, variables, locals, outputs
Running static validation, dependency graph checks, and plan summaries
Pushing changes to GitLab pipelines
Reducing IaC authoring time by 40% and eliminating low-quality code

Feb 2022 – May 2023
Sr. Cloud DevOps Engineer
Architected highly available Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters using Terraform with modular IaC patterns for VNets, NSGs, Route Tables, ACR, Managed Identities, Load Balancers, and Azure Monitor.
Built microservices deployment systems using Helm, Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure DevOps Pipelines, ensuring repeatable deployment of 5G network service functions.
Automated cluster lifecycle operations (scaling, upgrades, node pools, RBAC) using Terraform and Rancher, improving operational consistency and reducing manual errors.
Implemented centralized logging and tracing via ELK + Jaeger, enhancing debugging for high-volume microservices and reducing MTTR by 55%.
Built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps (YAML), integrating quality gates, artifact storage, policy checks, Helm packaging, automated tests, and multi-cluster deployments.
Automated infrastructure and application configuration using Ansible, enabling consistent deployments across Dev/Stage/Prod.
Implemented Pod Security Policies, Azure Key Vault integration, CNI networking, and managed identities for secure cluster communication.
Used Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Prometheus, and Grafana to build complete observability for 5G services.
Integrated ACR image scanning, security baselines, Kubernetes CIS benchmarks, and container vulnerability scanning.
Implemented Blue/Green and Canary deployments using Helm + App Gateway for zero-downtime rollouts.
